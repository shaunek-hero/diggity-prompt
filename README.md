It renders the CWD followed by, some colorful chevron chars (❯❯❯), and with right-aligned Git VCS info (if in a repo directory) and the execution time.

## Installation
If you are using zap as your zsh plugin manager just include this in .zshrc:
```zsh
plug "shaunek-hero/diggity-prompt"
```
Then relaunch your terminal.  Instructions could differ with different plugin manager or if you raw dog it with no plugin manager.

# Credits
A simple theme based off off [zap-prompt](https://https://github.com/zap-zsh/zap-prompt) by zap-zsh. The style was inspired by the sorin theme in zprezto, and some inspiration was also pulled from [singularisart-prompt](https://github.com/zap-zsh/singularisart-prompt).
